### **About me**
My first profession if the teacher of foreign languages, English and French. When I started to work at a school I realized that this all is not for me and I need to find something that encourages me. This was when I found the vacancy in the IT-company GDC Services with the help of my knowledge in English. Firstly, I was a cross-functional manager. Of course, that job was not all that I wanted, I needed progress so I started looking for a programming course. Fortunately, I found the C# Internship right in my company, and after a hard preparation and going through the interviews I was accepted. The internship was successful and I got the job of C# Developer. 

At the monent I am on the maternity leave and I want to continue improving my programming skills. With no doubt I can say that I am a hardworking, patient and eager to learn, learn and work.
